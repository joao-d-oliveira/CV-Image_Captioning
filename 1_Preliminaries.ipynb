While following the instructions in this notebook, please keep the data loader in training mode by setting `mode='train'`.\n","3. **`batch_size`** - determines the batch size.  When training the model, this is number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step.\n","4. **`vocab_threshold`** - the total number of times that a word must appear in the in the training captions before it is used as part of the vocabulary.  Words that have fewer than `vocab_threshold` occurrences in the training captions are considered unknown words. \n","5. **`vocab_from_file`** - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file.  \n","\n","We will describe the `vocab_threshold` and `vocab_from_file` arguments in more detail soon.

If you are unfamiliar with data loaders and datasets, you are encouraged to review [this PyTorch tutorial](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html).\n","\n","### Exploring the `__getitem__` Method\n","\n","The `__getitem__` method in the `CoCoDataset` class determines how an image-caption pair is pre-processed before being incorporated into a batch.  This is true for all `Dataset` classes in PyTorch; if this is unfamiliar to you, please review [the tutorial linked above](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html). \n","\n","When the data loader is in training mode, this method begins by first obtaining the filename (`path`) of a training image and its corresponding caption (`caption`).\n","\n","#### Image Pre-Processing \n","\n","Image pre-processing is relatively straightforward (from the `__getitem__` method in the `CoCoDataset` class):\n","```python\n","# Convert image to tensor and pre-process using transform\n","image = Image.open(os.path.join(self.img_folder, path)).convert('RGB')\n","image = self.transform(image)\n","```\n","After loading the image in the training folder with name `path`, the image is pre-processed using the same transform (`transform_train`) that was supplied when instantiating the data loader.  \n","\n","#### Caption Pre-Processing \n","\n","The captions also need to be pre-processed and prepped for training. In this example, for generating captions, we are aiming to create a model that predicts the next token of a sentence from previous tokens, so we turn the caption associated with any image into a list of tokenized words, before casting it to a PyTorch tensor that we can use to train the network.\n","\n","To understand in more detail how COCO captions are pre-processed, we'll first need to take a look at the `vocab` instance variable of the `CoCoDataset` class.  The code snippet below is pulled from the `__init__` method of the `CoCoDataset` class:\n","```python\n","def __init__(self, transform, mode, batch_size, vocab_threshold, vocab_file, start_word, \n","        end_word, unk_word, annotations_file, vocab_from_file, img_folder):\n","        ...\n","        self.vocab = Vocabulary(vocab_threshold, vocab_file, start_word,\n","            end_word, unk_word, annotations_file, vocab_from_file)\n","        ...\n","```\n","From the code snippet above, you can see that `data_loader.dataset.vocab` is an instance of the `Vocabulary` class from **vocabulary.py**.  Take the time now to verify this for yourself by looking at the full code in **data_loader.py**.  \n","\n","We use this instance to pre-process the COCO captions (from the `__getitem__` method in the `CoCoDataset` class):\n","\n","```python\n","# Convert caption to tensor of word ids.\n","tokens = nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(str(caption).lower())   # line 1\n","caption = []                                                 # line 2\n","caption.append(self.vocab(self.vocab.start_word))            # line 3\n","caption.extend([self.vocab(token) for token in tokens])      # line 4\n","caption.append(self.vocab(self.vocab.end_word))              # line 5\n","caption = torch.Tensor(caption).long()                       # line 6\n","```\n","\n","As you will see soon, this code converts any string-valued caption to a list of integers, before casting it to a PyTorch tensor.
